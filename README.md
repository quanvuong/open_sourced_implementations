## Open-sourced Implementations

It seems true that in Machine Learning research, only reading a research paper is sometimes not enough to absorb all the knowledge and information that were produced. Deeply understanding the implementation is important too. To extrapolate from Feynman's famous quote, the best way to understand something is to create it. That explains the existence of these implementations.
